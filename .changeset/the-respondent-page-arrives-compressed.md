The respondent page and the public asset read are transferred compressed, like everything else MJAPI sends.

MJServer mounts `compression()` at `index.ts:1129`, long after it collects the routes contributed through `ConfigureExpressApp` at `index.ts:824`, and Express dispatches layers in registration order — so both routes finished their responses before the compressor could wrap `res.write`. `GET /f/:slug` went out as ~9 KB of uncompressed HTML to every respondent who opened a shared link, however much gzip and brotli their browser had offered, on the phones and cellular connections this product is built for. It compresses to about 47% of that. This is the same defect #121 fixed for the widget bundle; both routes were scoped out of that change on purpose and are finished here.

**Both routes moved to `GetPreAuthMiddleware`, the slot the base class documents as running "after compression but before OAuth/REST/GraphQL routes".** A handler in that slot has no route pattern, so each route now matches its own path — and the rules Express's router applied are not obvious ones to re-derive: the literal is case-insensitive, exactly one trailing slash is tolerated, and the `:param` arrives percent-decoded. Those rules live in one place (`http/route-match.ts`) shared by all three routes that need them, pinned to a table probed case by case against a live Express app, because a move that quietly narrows a public URL sends a respondent to MJAPI's authenticated routes and a bare 401 that nothing explains.

**The asset half saves nothing on a default host, and is taken anyway.** `FORMS_ASSET_ALLOWED_TYPES` defaults to PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP; `mime-db` marks all four incompressible, so `compression.filter` was never going to encode them in either slot. The defect is the registration slot rather than the payload — an operator who adds `image/svg+xml` to the allowlist would otherwise inherit the bug with no sign of it, and leaving one route in the broken slot would preserve the trap for whoever next asks why the respondent path is slow.

**Operators should expect one behaviour change beyond the bytes.** Pre-auth contributions are mounted as one ordered chain, so these routes are no longer ahead of every other pre-auth handler — they are behind them, including MJ's global `RateLimitMiddleware` (off by default). A host that switches rate limiting on will see the respondent page and form images counted, where they were previously exempt. That is the right posture for public unauthenticated routes, but a respondent refused there sees an error page or a broken image rather than a rate-limit explanation.

Also fixed, same root cause: `POST /f/:slug/resume` never saw the globally mounted request-identity handler either, so its rate limit keyed on the form's slug instead of the caller — one bucket every respondent of a link shared, which a single caller could spend. It now keys on the resolved peer, as the page route already did.
