Make Forms installable on PostgreSQL, without a CodeGen run.

**A minor rather than a patch, because a new install target ships.** `migrations-pg/` previously held nothing but a README saying it was empty until the SQL Server migrations existed. It now carries the two converted DDL/metadata migrations plus one `.pgonly.sql` capture of CodeGen's PostgreSQL objects, so a PostgreSQL host can install Forms the way a consumer actually installs an Open App — `mj app install`, not `mj codegen`. No SQL Server behaviour changes: `migrations/` is untouched.

**Verified on a virgin PostgreSQL 16.11** — the oldest major supported, deliberately, not the newest — with MJ core and bizapps-common installed first (Forms hard-FKs `__mj_BizAppsCommon.Person`). Result: 10 tables, 10 base views, 30 CRUD functions, 10 triggers, 10 entities, 121 fields, 39 permissions, 13 relationships; a subsequent `mj codegen` produces a 0-line diff across metadata, `pg_get_viewdef`/`functiondef`/`triggerdef` and column defaults; a 19-assertion functional test (`scripts/pg-objectmodel-test.mjs`) passes; MJAPI boots against it. Runbook and measured numbers in `migrations-pg/docs/PG_INSTALL_VERIFICATION.md`.

**The CodeGen objects are captured from the catalog, not from CodeGen's SQL log.** That log records only entities whose metadata changed, and these migrations already carry the metadata — so CodeGen logged almost nothing while still building every object. Without the capture an install has tables and registered entities but no base views and no CRUD functions, i.e. nothing the API can read or write through.

**`mj.config.cjs` gains lower-case twins** for `schemaPlaceholders`, `includeSchemas` and `NameRulesBySchema`. PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers, so CodeGen reads the schema back as `__mj_bizappsforms` while these rules match case-sensitively; the generic `__mj` rule then matches that name's *prefix* and emits `${mjSchema}_bizappsforms`, a schema that does not exist. The same pass names `__mj_BizAppsCommon` explicitly, which had no rule at all and was being rewritten by the generic rule in the shipped T-SQL (harmlessly there, since `mjSchema` is `__mj` — but it is a reference this repo does not own).

Several converter gaps in CLI 5.51.0 are worked around here and worth reporting upstream: `--bake-codegen` emitted no CodeGen objects; BIT→BOOLEAN literals were not coerced (1,590 rewritten by looking each target column's type up in `information_schema`); the schema qualifier came out quoted in `CREATE TABLE` and unquoted in `ALTER TABLE`; cross-schema `REFERENCES` kept a mixed-case schema name that no unquoted schema matches; and the four CodeGen reconciliation `EXECUTE`s were reported unhandled despite existing natively on PostgreSQL — they are ported as `SELECT`s because they rewrite placeholder field `Sequence` values into real ordinals.
