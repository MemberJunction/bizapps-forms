The AI Designer stops proposing a question type the database rejects, and the release ships one consolidated metadata seed instead of a pile of per-PR deltas.

**The shipped Designer prompt still said `Signature`.** #97 renamed the type to `Doodle` and `V202608301200` installed a CHECK constraint that accepts only the new spelling — but that migration is pure DDL, and the prompt lives in a metadata record no DDL touches. So a host installing from `migrations/` got a prompt proposing `Signature` and a constraint refusing it. The blueprint validator rejects the value before it ever reaches the database, and the Designer retries with the error fed back, up to `MAX_DESIGNER_ATTEMPTS` — wasted round-trips on every authored form rather than a visible failure, which is why nothing surfaced it. No repo-side check could: `check:release-seed` compares declared ids against shipped SQL, and this record's id already shipped in the v0.8 seed.

**Two unreleased deltas are folded in and deleted.** `V202608182130` and `V202608241800` appear in no release tag, so neither reached a host and neither was append-only history yet. They are replaced by a single `Metadata_Sync` generated against the shipped chain — the cadence #105 established, and what `check:seed-cadence` has been red on.

**Operators should expect this**: applying this migration corrects the Designer prompt in place and adds the four `OnSubmit` `ActionParam` records. No form data is touched, and `V202608301200` already migrated any stored `Signature` questions to `Doodle`.

Closes #111.
