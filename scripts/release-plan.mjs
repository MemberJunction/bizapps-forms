/**
 * What work does this release run still have to do?
 *
 * The step this replaces asked ONE question — is `packages/Entities`'s version on npm? — and hung
 * both remaining actions off the answer. That conflates two independent facts, and #177's review
 * found the state where they disagree: `changeset publish` publishes the unpublished set with
 * `Promise.all`, so one package landing while a sibling fails is a state it produces BY DESIGN and
 * expects a retry to finish (it skips already-published packages). The old signal read that state
 * as "done", so the retry skipped publish AND tag and reported success — leaving packages
 * unpublished and no `v<version>` tag, which `check-release-seed-cadence.mjs` then reads as
 * "this release never shipped" at the NEXT release.
 *
 * So the two facts are answered separately, and each gates its own step:
 *
 *   publish — is ANY publishable package missing this version from npm?
 *   tag     — is the `v<version>` tag absent?
 *
 * A run is a no-op only when both are false. That makes a retry after ANY partial failure finish
 * the job, which is the property the design this replaced had for free (its signal was un-consumed
 * changesets on the remote, removed by a single write after publish and tag) and this one had lost.
 *
 * It is a script rather than inline bash for the reason `sync-app-version.mjs` is: a decision that
 * only ever runs inside a release cannot be proven by running a release. Plain Node, stdlib only.
