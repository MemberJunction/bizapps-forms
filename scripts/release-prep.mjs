/**
 * Can a release be cut from this checkout — and, with `--apply`, the LOCAL half of cutting one.
 *
 * #177 did not fix the release automation, it deleted it: once #173 made seven checks required on
 * both `main` and `next`, every push CI made to a protected branch became unsatisfiable by
 * construction (GH013, because required checks are evaluated against check runs present on the SHA
 * being introduced), so the pipeline was replaced by a hand runbook in docs/release.md. That runbook
 * has never been executed — v0.10.0 was cut by the automation #177 removed, and nothing has shipped
 * since. Restoring it keeps #177's rule intact rather than weakening it: no protected branch is
 * pushed, the work moves to an UNPROTECTED `release/*` branch, and a pull request into `main`
 * carries it the way a human's does.
 *
 * The split of labour is the load-bearing part of this file. This script decides and mutates the
 * WORKING TREE; it performs no push, no GitHub API call and no network write of any kind. The
 * workflow owns every remote identity. That is what keeps the decision rehearsable: `--plan` runs on
 * a developer's laptop and answers "is a release due?" without touching anything, and a decision
 * that only ever executed inside a release could never be proven by running a release — the same
 * reason sync-app-version.mjs and release-plan.mjs are scripts rather than inline workflow bash.
 *
 * Where the three release scripts divide:
 *   release-prep.mjs  (here)  before the bump — may we cut one, and what version is it?
 *   sync-app-version.mjs      during the bump — mj-app.json's derived fields.
 *   release-plan.mjs          after the merge — is there still publishing or tagging left to do?
 *
 * Plain Node, stdlib only: a gate that guards the release must run in CI without installing
 * anything.
