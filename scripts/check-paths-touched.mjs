/**
 * Answers one question for the two workflows whose jobs are too expensive to run unconditionally:
 * did this diff touch anything matching these patterns?
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT WITH A SPEC AND NOT A `grep -qE` IN YAML ────────────────────────────────
 * Since #173 the gate jobs are REQUIRED checks, and the two skip mechanisms are not symmetric:
 *
 *   - A workflow skipped by an `on: paths:` filter creates NO check run. The pull request sits on
 *     "Expected — Waiting for status" and can never be merged.
 *   - A job skipped by a job-level `if:` reports conclusion `skipped`, which a required status
 *     check treats as PASSING.
 *
 * So the filtering moved out of `on:` and into the job — and that makes a wrong answer here
 * dangerous in a way it never was before. Answer `false` when the diff really was relevant and the
 * expensive job is skipped, reports SUCCESS, and the pull request goes green having built nothing.
 * That is a silently-green gate, which is the failure this repository keeps re-fixing.
 *
 * Therefore: every uncertainty resolves to `true`. An unreadable diff, a missing or all-zeroes base
 * or head SHA (the all-zeroes case shows up on a brand-new branch's parent, or a still-forming ref
 * on the other side), an empty pattern list — all run the job. The cost of a wrong `true` is runner
 * minutes. The cost of a wrong `false` is a lie.
 *
 * ── NODE STDLIB ONLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Like every other gate here: no dependencies, no marketplace action, so a dependency problem can
 * never be the reason nobody finds out the build did not run. `git` is the single external binary
 * and its absence is treated as an unreadable diff, i.e. fail open.
 *
 * ── PATTERN SYNTAX ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Deliberately two forms, not a glob engine. A trailing `/` means prefix ("packages/"); anything
 * else must match a changed path exactly ("turbo.json"). That is every shape the two callers need,
 * and a glob engine nobody needs is a second thing to get wrong.
