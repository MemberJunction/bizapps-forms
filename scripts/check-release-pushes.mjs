/**
 * Refuse any push to a ruleset-protected branch from the release path.
 *
 * Required status checks are evaluated against the check runs present on the SHA being introduced.
 * On a direct push that SHA does not exist on the remote until the push lands, so no check run can
 * exist for it yet — a direct push to a ref carrying `required_status_checks` is unsatisfiable by
 * construction, for any commit, with or without `[skip ci]`. It is not a race that a retry wins.
 *
 * That is what #177 was: `ci/commit_push.mjs` pushed the version-bump commit straight to `main` and
 * `ci/merge_main_and_update_lock.mjs` pushed straight to `next`, and once #173 made both rulesets
 * carry required checks, every release stopped at the version-bump step with GH013. The fix was to
 * stop pushing; this gate is what keeps it fixed, because reintroducing such a push breaks nothing
 * until the next release — months later, in someone else's pull request.
 *
 * Tag pushes are deliberately allowed: both rulesets are `target: branch`, scoped to
 * `refs/heads/main` and `refs/heads/next`, so `refs/tags/*` is untouched and the release still
 * tags itself.
 *
 * Plain Node, stdlib only, matching `check-migration-order.mjs`: a gate that guards the release
 * must be runnable in CI without installing anything.
